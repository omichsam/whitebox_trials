First, Malindians Interactive Services also referred to as ""Malindians"" is an information portal for the town of Malindi providing information about Malindi for tourists visiting the town. It features tourist facilities - hotels & accommodation, restaurants & cafés, bars, and clubs, culture, and other attractions. It is a youth-driven platform that showcases and tells the stories of the people of Malindi, the Malindians. _x000D_
Our second program is the Malindi Business & Art Exhibition (MBAE). MBAE is a program to train, support, incubate and empower young people in business to access markets. Our target sectors include fine art, beadwork, carvings, crafts, print fashion (T-shirts, Kangas, bandanas), and e-commerce. The program in particular targets single mothers and idle young men susceptible to radicalization and drug abuse.  _x000D_
","Our primary target for the tourist platform is the local tourist seeking a holiday destination and a memorable experience. Naturally, the international tourist is our secondary market as it is still attractive. _x000D_
For the exhibition, we target local residents in Malindi, Kilifi, Mombasa, tourists, and businesses across the country. ","We recognize that the unemployment problem is created by reduced tourist numbers in Malindi. The hub retrains the youth, generates value by creating employment for skilled youth in the town, supports business start-ups in the area through the exhibition, driving tourists (especially local tourists) to Malindi. These benefits will create a ripple effect in the economy of the town; salvage families, reduce crime rates, discourage the allure of radicalization and help eliminate drug abuse. _x000D_
Our unique strategy in attaining this is the use of innovative technology platforms to disseminate information and capture a market.  _x000D_

The company offers a wide range of quality products such as personal effects (Toothbrush and Toothpaste, Bathing Soap, Washing Soap and Powder, Towel, Metallic Washing Buckets, Tissue Rolls, Sanitary Towels, Hair Combs, Hand Mirrors, Slippers, Shoe Polish), Stationeries (Pens and Pencils, notebooks, Geometrical Sets, Scientific Calculators, Set Books), Schoolbags, Face Masks, Uniforms, Mattresses, Dictionaries, Kamusi, Four Figure Mathematical Tables, Photocopy Papers (Ream) Belts, Exams, Text Books, and Chain-links among others. _x000D_
Having been created for a comrade by a comrade, the company uses the knowledge gained from studying the everyday behavior of this market niche to provide quality products and services that guarantee customer satisfaction._x000D_
","Millions of high students in Kenyan Secondary Boarding Schools, their parents, and Teachers","Imagine all the struggles and troubles these young high school students have to go through every time schools are opening. Having to carry with themselves very bulky shopping bags in this very undisciplined matatu industry on their way to school is never an easy task. In several instances, students have ended up losing their valuable items or having their shopping vandalized while on transit as conductors focus on maximizing profits on every route covered. _x000D_
On the other hand, how hectic is the process of inspecting hundreds of luggage's on the reporting date? With the Corona Pandemic, this process has become not only tiresome but also risky. Remember, students come across different surfaces and routes on their way to school. And having in mind that an inspection has to be conducted at the gate, this practice exposes the teaching and non-teaching staff to the dangers of contracting the virus._x000D_
Lastly, how often have students got exposed to drugs, injuries, and other dangers outside the school environment while on permission to restock their shopping? Although this issue is more common in boys' schools, it is a challenge that needs to be addressed. The parents have put 100% trust in the school management to safeguard the students while under their custody. But is there any wrong with allowing students out to restock their shopping for a comfortable stay in school? Definitely not. But it is from such doings that some managements have found themselves under so much pressure when certain right decisions result in unanticipated outcomes._x000D_
Therefore, our business seeks to address some of the above challenges. Through our online platform, students no longer have to worry about bulky luggage's on their school opening dates, teaching and non-teaching staff no longer have to worry about the hectic inspection process and the Corona Virus contracting risk while parents will have a 100% assurance that their students are in school full time until the official breaking dates.

The business takes advantage of the vast unoccupied lands in the lower parts of Mbeere where hives have been mounted in the bushes to harness honey from the housed swarms. After harvesting , honey is processed by means of extracting the honey from the honey combs and packaged for distribution. Currently , the project reaches local customers but there are plans to expand the project to reach consumers beyond the locality. This is a phase that will be preceded by first aligning the product as per KEBS standards, and consequently, licensing . The honey combs are also sold to pharmaceutical companies. The project initially employs only three persons but it is aimed at employing more locals through recruiting them into production of the honey thus generating income for the community at large. ","Many of us enjoy honey and incorporate it into our daily diet, whether as a natural sugar substitute for our coffee or simply as a sweet treat. But specific honey varietals known as “active” honeys have also been utilized throughout history for their antibacterial and medicinal properties. Honeys presenting unique antibacterial properties are found across different geographic regions around the world from Malaysia and Chile, to Yemen in the Middle-East. Active honeys are characterized by the existence of bio-active compounds found within them. Hydrogen peroxide is one of its bio-active compounds which has shown effectiveness as an antibacterial agent. However, active honeys can also be influenced by additional factors such as osmotic pressure, pH and the presence of other phenolic compounds.Health benefits such as anti-inflammatory, anti-allergenic, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties are attributable to these phenolic compounds.1 As technology and analytics for laboratory testing has improved in recent times, we now have a better understanding of the nature of these bio-active components, where they originate from and how they enable us to use honey as a medicine.In the era of “Super bugs” and bacteria which seem to be outpacing the production of new and effective antibiotics, the efficacy of natural alternatives is being closely examined. This has also included discovering the medical uses of honey —particularly for wound care. High grade honey can be used to impregnate medical dressings for advanced wound care. These have shown positive results against aggressive skin infections, specifically Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA).","The product is bout to provide a wide range of nutrients in the consumers not forgetting the many health benefits tied to the use of honey. Honey is used in the treatment of eye diseases, bronchial asthma, throat infections, tuberculosis, thirst, hiccups, fatigue, dizziness, hepatitis, constipation, worm infestation, piles, eczema, healing of ulcers, and wounds. ",0-6 months,"Less than ksh 50,000","Finances-to be able to produce sufficient honey, capital is required in the initial set up of the hives, training the handlers, processing and distribution. _x000D_
In addition, the huge amount of money required to obtain a standardization permit is in a way affecting sales since it is a prerequisite for products on the shelves in big retail shops despite the product being purely agricultural. _x000D_

The drone is equipped with sensors and different hardware capable of spraying, sowing and fertilizer spreading and in special cases carry out soil profiling and crop count to determine the percentage of crop germination. The drone has been found to be a good tool for reclamation of farming land as it can work on all terrain as well as all weather. It has also proven to be a good tool for forest land reclamation as it is capable of spreading tree seeds over large areas and in a very short duration of time.",The business serves both small scale and large scale farmers as it is capable of operating on both large and small farms effectively and efficiently. Under special cases the drone can also be used to serve institutions such as the agriculture research institute and Kenya wildlife services to monitor and minimize human wildlife conflicts eg by throwing pepper balls on elephants to prevent them from entering into peoples farms and also as a tool for tree seeds sowing in order to increase the forest cover.,"The previous farm maintenance systems are affected by terrain, height of the crops as well as weather. example a tractor sprayer cannot work on marshy ground as it will get stuck on the mud. this system is also not suitable for small farms._x000D_
 similarly, the motorized sprayer carried by human is tiresome and thus not appropriate for large scale farms. these systems are also affected by the time of day, the height of the crops and the weather. Tall crops such as maize are hard to spray once they go beyond the knee height._x000D_
The two systems are not economical as they require alot of input in terms of pesticides and other inputs, time and money. They are also not environmentally friendly as they produce alot of smoke which adds to the carbon footprint in the atmosphere. _x000D_
The drone therefore is there to solve all the above, where it will work on both small scale and large scale farms, saving hugely on pesticides and other inputs as well as reduce significantly the amount of time required to spray or carry other farm maintenance practices. It will not be affected by the height of the crop as it flies above them with ease, neither will it be affected by the time of day or the weather.

The business, YNE, is supposed to cater to the Digital community and their needs. Everything from developing Websites, designing Posters, Brochures, Book Covers, Business Cards, Business Heads and even Business Logos. _x000D_
_x000D_
The pandemic taught us something: that most people can work from home simply by using the internet. And Businesses today, now understand that their customers can be found online, because that is where they spend most of their time. This is where we come in: we fill in that space by making ourselves available to meet that need: help find, reach and bring in their customers using the Digital Space. How? By building interactive and engaging websites for them, as well as creating graphic designs for businesses that wish to capture the audiences attention. _x000D_
_x000D_
Of course, we plan on augmenting our services by using top notch applications and software. However, today, to get quality Graphic Design software, a purchase needs to be done. And its not cheap. And to build the type of websites we wish to create will also take a certain amount of investment in software and better functioning computers.. Funds to invest in our business idea has been the biggest challenge in moving forward._x000D_
_x000D_
We also recognized another niche: the Video era. From YouTube and TikTok videos to Instagram reels, we are surrounded by visual content. And businesses also need to tap into that to reach and interact with their customers. We come in and provide video editing services for those that lack the time to do so. But that also requires a top functioning video editor that can withstand large files and perform numerous functions. This has also been another factor hindering our progress. ","It will serve the Businesses that need to reach their customers via an online platform. It also caters to those companies looking to build a digital online presence. This is through video editing, website and graphic design.",The number one problem our business is designed to solve is the lack of time companies today lack in building an online presence to reach their audience. We fill that gap by doing the nitty gritty of building an enviable online presence for our clients so they can have time to do the big stuff. ,0-6 months,None,Lack of funds,No,,"I read that the program offers Entrepreneurship classes, and I think we could benefit greatly from it. Entrepreneurship is a new field for us, and learning how to navigate it will no doubt help us grow, augment our profit and revenue and even learn how to stay ahead of competition. _x000D_
_x000D_
Recently, I learned that the most important aspect of a business is sales or the ability to sell something to someone else. One can't make profit from their services or products if they have no idea how to put them up on the market and sell it to the people. So, perhaps this would also be a part of the Entrepreneurship classes. _x000D_
_x000D_
Another reason is to be able to financial support. This will help us get on our two feet as a business by setting up shop and purchasing the, hardware, software and applications that we require for the business. _x000D_
_x000D_
In summary, we require support through the provision of intellectual knowledge and monetary value. ",Referred by someone,On someone's WhatsApp Status,"Perhaps increase awareness of the program. Today's youth spend very little time watching news or even the TV. But you will find them on YouTube and Instagram. Perhaps advertising on these platforms would help increase your reach._x000D_

The Academy will provide skills and training to reduce poverty crisis and which our country grapples with daily. Moreover, since  poverty is exacerbated by unemployment and lack of basic skills to work in a workplace YRec Juakali Academy hopes to bridge this gap. _x000D_
","The Academy targets at-risk youths aged 18 to 25 especially from disadvantaged backgrounds, school dropouts and under-performing school graduates. _x000D_
_x000D_
Statistics from the Kenyan national census held in 2019 showed that 75% of the population were youths aged 18 to 35 years, further, Kenya Bureau of Statistics cites that 3 in 5 unemployed persons are youths which demonstrates the unemployment crisis in the country. _x000D_
_x000D_
Moreover, the cost of starting a business in Kenya is significantly high which daunts youths ambitions of starting businesses with the majority delaying their ambitions as they look for capital albeit without any skills to be employed. Vocational training costs on the other hand are still very expensive despite the government’s efforts in waiving the fees the at-risk youths especially from disadvantaged backgrounds are still unable to pursue or finish school._x000D_

•	Entrepreneurship module : business management , and  online businesses and  consultancy _x000D_

•	Job readiness module: Interview techniques, CV writing _x000D_
•	After school module: Mentorship and consultancy services._x000D_
_x000D_
The 8 weeks training will enable the entrepreneurial trainees start a basic business with a minimum capital requirements and skills since the Academy targets that the business they start will require 10$ only . The ones who want to be employed will be helped to secure an entry level job without the employers looking at the KCSE/KCPE grades._x000D_

Vooli utilizes APIs from a multiple insurance companies to develop an array insurance quotes( from cheap to expensive) according to the data points we have collected from the client. This comparative pricing significantly lowers the cost of insurance since one can aggregate his/her risk with one company or select different companies for different risks._x000D_
The platform eliminates totally the current touchpoint model used by insurance, this consequently removes fraud through collusion and enhances the smoothness of service delivery._x000D_
_x000D_
This consequently enables deeper understanding of the clients needs and improves customer centricity from the insurance company and all other  players in the value chain promoting price sensitivity and thereby inclusivity._x000D_
","General insurance clients._x000D_
In 2021,there are 490 million people in Africa living in extreme poverty(ie earn less than $1.9 dollars per day), or 36% of the total population. This number is up from 481 million in 2019. As a whole, Africa is not on target to meet it’s Sustainable Development Goal 1 – Eradicate Poverty by 2030._x000D_
_x000D_
This is because access to basic financial services is wanting, their needs includes firstly, education about insurance, secondly cheaper and tailor made services rather than the blanket covers that exist and most importantly a reliable and interactive platform for delivery of policies, customer service and payout incase of claims._x000D_
In Africa, MSMEs are estimated to contribute 70 percent of the region’s total employment. However,99.9 % of these have even the basic business insurance._x000D_
_x000D_
Consequently, when a peril occurs eg fire, then the blunt of the loss is passed to the proprietor leading to personal losses and consequently poverty._x000D_
_x000D_
Vooli insurtech comes in to resolve this issue, by offering targeted insurance in all classes, we eliminate the problem of blanket cover insurance cover making insurance cheap hence inclusive._x000D_
_x000D_
All these services are delivered in a personalized app and web platform in a low pressure, interactive and professional manner","Low insurance penetration - Africa's insurance penetration has stagnated at 2.8% average, over 97 % of the population is uninsured._x000D_
_x000D_
Fraud- The insurance sector in Kenya has recorded KES3.27bn ($30.05m) in underwriting losses, its worst in over two decades majorly due to fraudulent claims._x000D_
_x000D_
Access to insurance and Inclusion- The insurance process is long, slow and winded and relies solely on salespeople leading to frustrations for the insureds._x000D_
The insurance delivery method is also completely broken, one can only insurance from brokers, agents or directly from the insurance company(which are mainly un the cities)_x000D_
_x000D_
● Buying from agents/brokers leaves you from the_x000D_
insurance company you have bought a policy from._x000D_
● Sometimes clients genuinely forget that their insurance cover_x000D_
has lapsed which ends up costing them a lot of money in fines._x000D_
● The process takes long for customers to complete due to_x000D_
the number of forms one needs to fill._x000D_
_x000D_
Finally, the systems used have no fraud detection mechanisms, this leaves the few who are insured at the mercy of fraudsters who masquerade as companies,$30 M in loss was reported in 2019 in Kenya, the worst over two decades._x000D_
_x000D_
The agency relies solely Technology to meet all it's registration, servicing, claim settlement procedures to reduce human error and eliminate fraud. Vooli takes this to the next level by fully blending_x000D_
insurance and API technology to automate the valuation and claim process completely and make it as seamless as possible. _x000D_
_x000D_
Our ambition is to use 0% paper in the entire process and with the support of our insurance carriers meet our clients’ needs fully._x000D_

framework for action through giving the clients access to policy data and companies an insight to track, measure_x000D_
and fulfil their part in customer-centric activation to drive customer loyalty._x000D_

In my experiential journey and learning, I have realize there are fewer institution that really help the human resource achieve its objective and purpose. As a result many have fallen trap of doing a job and career they don’t like hence reducing organizational effectiveness and efficiency. In many instances, most of the corporate leaders miss on the nitty-gritties of principle of leadership and people management skills. As a result, the team leader is totally disconnected with the team. Better still, many organization are not enjoying or experiencing the required inner potential of its employees._x000D_
On the individual basis, many professionals have failed to really understand what on earth are supposed to do, the question of purpose and vision.

ShambaAssistant is a cheap and comprehensive data collection tool that allows (small and medium-scale) farmers in Kenya to collect data from their farms easily. The data include Soil Moisture, Soil PH, Soil Nitrogen, Potassium and Phosphorus Content, Air Humidity, Air Temperature, and Crop images._x000D_
The data is automatically uploaded on the cloud, where images are analyzed with an Artificial Intelligence model to determine crop health hence predict expected yields and the presence of symptoms of crop pests and crop diseases. Moreover, soil data is mapped to our geographical information mapping system. From the data analysis, feedback to guide farmers is relayed through USSD, SMS, and Calls to advise on the suitable fertilizer input and recommended pesticide to use._x000D_
","Our target customers are small and medium-scale farmers in Kenya, without internet access or smartphones. This category consists of up to 70% of small and medium-scale farms. Interestingly 98% of the population have access to feature phones. While existing solutions on-farm data collection and analysis require access to the internet and the use of smartphones to upload data and give feedback through the web or mobile apps, we target to utilize USSD and SMS service only.","The specific problem we seek to address is the lack of a structured and affordable data collection method and infrastructure that allows for integration with 4th industrial technologies such as the internet of things, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and remote sensing, therefore, impeding assimilation of precision farming among small and medium-scale farmers in Kenya._x000D_
Precision farming is data-driven agriculture, it helps reduce the cost of production and maximizes farm yields. It is the future of successful agriculture. By frequently analyzing data from the farm, farmers are able to know what to plant, when to plant, what fertilizer to use, and when and where to use the fertilizers. Unfortunately, the technology involved in the data collection; drones, and satellites are too expensive and inaccessible in developing countries. Additionally, agricultural extension services are not available to support frequent testing of the soil. Without effective and cheap data, the collection method of precision farming is limited.",6-12 months,None,"Lack of industrial linkages: It is a major challenge to look for an industrial and market connection to help you venture into the market.

Our logistics solutions include freight, storage/warehousing and fulfillment._x000D_
FREIGHT:Our freight solutions focuses on getting items from point A to point B as quickly and efficiently as possible. We realized the level of disorganization and the inefficiency in the logistics sector, and decided to do something about it. The platform provides a forum for the negotiation of prices between a cargo owner and the transporter. It brings in the aspect of competitive freight bidding, which means that the transporter that bids the lowest price gets to move the goods._x000D_
STORAGE/WAREHOUSING: Incase the cargo owner requires storage space, we provide the same with space rentals starting from as little as a pallet, or 2 metres squared to as much as a whole warehouse and a minimum storage period of 5 days. We also have a storage-by-bin model for e-commerce vendors. When a vendor has excess stock, we supply the storage bins, they pack the stock and we store until they need it back._x000D_
FULFILLMENT: A solution for e-commerce stores and distributors, where we help them pick-pack-deliver their goods. We use our freight and warehousing infrastructure to handle the entire process._x000D_
Logistics+Tech is definitely a winner. For a very long period of time, logistics activities have traditionally been conducted using the traditional paper/person model. Loadmoran wants to change this by introducing technology into the whole chain of logistics. _x000D_
_x000D_
REVENUE MODEL:_x000D_
- Upon successful negotiation between the customer and transporter, the customer pays a 70% deposit upfront and we pay the transporter a 50% advance payment._x000D_
- Upon Load delivery, the customer pays the remaining balance._x000D_
- We then charge the transporter a 10-15% commission for that load._x000D_
- For Instance, moving a 20FT container from Mombasa to Kampala currently costs about 2,400 USD (~ Ksh 244,000), charging a 10% commission= Ksh. 24,400. If we move one load a day on that particular route alone, this translates to ~ Ksh. 732,000 per month._x000D_
- Storage: we charge a flat rate per day depending on storage size required. We also have storage by-bin model. Each bin is charged a flat rate per day, depending on bin size._x000D_
_x000D_
Logistics+Tech is definitely a winner. For a very long period of time, logistics activities have traditionally been conducted using the traditional paper/person model. Loadmoran wants to change this by introducing technology into the whole chain of logistics. This will in turn bring in efficiency and help to considerably lower the cost of goods in the country and continent at large. Kenya has a 91% penetration of mobile subscriptions with Internet access through the mobile phone in the country recently hitting an all time high of 83%. This implies that our service can be accessed almost anywhere in the country.","Target Market & Opportunity:_x000D_
- Small Transporters and individual operators._x000D_
- Large Transporters with sizable truck fleet_x000D_
- Shippers/Cargo owners._x000D_
- Freight forwarders and Cargo Clearing companies._x000D_
- E-commerce stores._x000D_
- Warehouse owners._x000D_
","In Africa, upto 75% of a product’s cost is due to logistics as compared to 6% in the USA. Loadmoran wants to implement a responsive transportation solution which will allow a more effective and economical transportation network that will lower the cost of goods. The system is designed to tackle a 180 Billion Dollar logistics problem in Africa by bringing together key players in the logistics chain (Cargo owner, transporter and warehousing)._x000D_
According to research done by the Kenya Transporters Association, on average, Kenyan trucks are presently doing 60,000 - 96,000 KMs/truck/year thus driving transport costs to an estimated 30% of the value of traded goods. In the most efficient trade corridors, the average KMs/truck/year is between 120,000 to 150,000, translating into significantly affordable transport and logistics costs of up to an average 4% of the value of traded goods.",6-12 months,"500,000-1,000,000","The biggest challenge we are currently facing is lack of sufficient funds for expansion of business activities. We believe that we've put enough measures and processes in place for the next phase which is growth._x000D_
The fund will will help us scale business activities such as onboarding more customers and partners (bike/van/pickup/truck owners). Our aim is to have as many vehicles registered on our platform as possible. This is only possible through intensive marketing, offering incentives such as fuel financing for the transporter, vehicle financing and timely payment. Another aspect that the fund would help us grow is establishment of fulfillment centres and the warehousing infrastructure._x000D_
Employees are a critical aspect of any venture. Getting the right talent is key to us and securing the fund would go a long way in helping us grow our talent pool in the company._x000D_
The fund would also help us grow our technology. In all our products, technology is key as it brings efficiency and lowers the cost of doing business. Therefore, growing our technology offering, scaling system functionalities and streamlining all our online processes is key.",No,,"Loadmoran is a freight matching platform designed to tackle a 180 Billion Dollar logistics problem in Africa by bringing together key players in the logistics chain of business, i.e. Cargo owners, transporters, Warehouses all under one platform through technology. We want to implement a responsive transportation and fulfillment solution which will allow a more effective and economical transportation network, while at the same time creating job opportunities for the young people in the region. We are currently looking for funding opportunities to help us scale business activities such as onboarding more partners, establishing fulfillment centres and technology upgrade. One of the goals of setting up the company was to create job opportunities for the young person. We believe the program can help us achieve this through funding, mentoring/coaching, networking and linking us to potential markets.","Facebook post, Press/Media Mention (newspaper, radio or TV) or Blog Article",,"Involving as many youth as possible on all matters of the council.

We believe by using modern technology, the very best engineering talent, and a mission-driven approach we can reinvent the payment experience at our shops in Kenya and beyond. Our solution, which is built on trust and transparency, make it easier for consumers to spend, purchase on credit responsibly and with confidence, easier for shopkeepers to convert sales and grow, and easier for commerce in Kenya to thrive._x000D_
_x000D_
Legacy payment options, archaic systems, and traditional risk and credit underwriting models can be harmful, deceptive, and restrictive to both consumers and merchants. They are not well-suited for increasingly digital and mobile-first commerce, and are built on legacy infrastructure that does not support the innovation required for modern commerce to evolve and flourish._x000D_
_x000D_
Our platform addresses these problems. Today, it comprises three core elements: a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers, merchant commerce solutions, and a consumer-focused app._x000D_
Our point-of-sale solution allows consumers to pay for purchases in fixed amounts without deferred interest, hidden fees, or penalties. _x000D_
_x000D_
","We empower consumers to pay over time rather than paying for a product entirely upfront. This increases consumers’ purchasing power and gives them more control and flexibility. Our platform facilitates both true 0% APR payment options and interest bearing loans. With 0% APR, consumers pay zero interest and zero additional costs. On the interest bearing loans we facilitate, we charge simple interest, which means consumers pay fixed amounts of interest that they agree to up front, and the interest never compounds. _x000D_
_x000D_
We believe in treating people fairly, which is why consumers never pay more than what was agreed to at checkout, even if they miss a payment. Paying with Shoplend not only protects consumers from hidden fees but allows them to avoid traps such as deferred interest._x000D_
_x000D_
We offer merchants highly effective commerce solutions that enhance demand generation and customer acquisition. Our solutions empower merchants to more efficiently promote and sell their products, optimize their customer acquisition strategies, and drive incremental sales. Our flexible payment solutions allow merchants to solve affordability for their customers, providing a revenue accelerator while avoiding discounting and other expensive marketing and promotional channels. We also provide valuable product-level data and insights — information that merchants cannot easily get elsewhere — to better inform their marketing strategies. Our approach allows us to add value throughout the full customer lifecycle, from acquisition, to conversion, to repeat transactions._x000D_
_x000D_
Our consumer-focused app unlocks the full suite of shoplend's products for a delightful end-to-end consumer experience. Consumers can use our app to manage payments, open a high-yield savings account, and access a personalized marketplace. Our marketplace serves as a discovery platform which allows consumers to find products and make purchases from partner merchants. In addition our app allows merchants to provide tailored offers based on consumers’ spending patterns, shopping habits, and purchase intent.","Merchants are currently facing rising customer acquisition costs, and existing solutions are insufficient_x000D_
The cost to acquire a customer and the cost to convert a sale are two of the biggest challenges facing merchants, and these costs are rising across almost every channel. Current payment solutions do little to help merchants attract and retain customers, forcing merchants to turn to discounts or promotional gimmicks. Alternative customer acquisition and marketing channels, such as online and social media advertising, are increasingly expensive due to the limited supply of digital ad space. As a result, both brick-and-mortar and online merchants of all sizes are looking to alternative strategies to acquire, convert, and retain customers more efficiently._x000D_
Not only are merchants experiencing challenges in running their business but consumers as well arefacing payment option challenges to satisfy their wants;This includes;_x000D_
Limitations of legacy offerings_x000D_
For consumers, when it comes to the act of making a purchase, there are a number of shortcomings with existing options:_x000D_
They are Complex,Providers have a Predatory lending mindset,Mispriced credit risk,Inflexible,Impersonal and a frustrating user experience_x000D_
​_x000D_
For merchants, when it comes to acquiring customers, improving conversions, and increasing order values, there are also a number of shortcomings with existing options:_x000D_
Difficulty in engaging and converting customers, Lack of viable consumer-friendly solutions that address unaffordability, Offering discounts can harm merchants’ brands, Abandoned carts , Lack of purchase intelligence, Limited benefits to existing payment networks_x000D_

Our Solution_x000D_

It’s about embarking on a journey of curiosity, one that is driven with passion for assessing gaps in our planet and curving a niche for themselves to fix them. Whether short or long, smooth or bumpy, exciting or dull, the end goal for this journey for the youth  is a fulfilled heart for doing something greater for mankind and for a better world. The humility of knowing this should be used to  motivates them to always arm themselves with two things: curiosity of mind and passion of heart, for they are the drivers of the entrepreneurial journey, no matter how bumpy it becomes._x000D_

• Grocery stores:- In my home area, all the 570 grocery stores only sell kales, _x000D_
tomatoes and onions. The moment Kwa Mushroom Farm will start harvesting, it _x000D_
will be the only farm delivering mushrooms to the market_x000D_
 _x000D_
 • People who work out in the gym do not have suppliments in their food or meals _x000D_
or menu especially after working out. Mushroom delicacy will definitely come in _x000D_
handy._x000D_
•College and university Students all the time prefer pre-ordered ready to eat foods _x000D_
rather than cooking. Kwa Mushroom Farm will also deliver well packed ready to eat _x000D_
different preparations of mushroom that will be beneficial in their bodies. _x000D_
• Our research suggests that those segments together represent a pool of more _x000D_
than 15,000 potential customers per day. Factor in the broad decline of the fast food industry, the complementary rising popularity of fast-casual options, the cool _x000D_
factor attached to innovative food trucks, and the town's strong population growth, _x000D_
and there is a great opportunity here.  ","'- Availability of nutritious food that is medicinal. Groups of people who have issues _x000D_

description to further educate on how and when to include mushroom in meals._x000D_
The specific people who have terminal diseases will benefit from the medicinal _x000D_

they do not have a back up income generating activity._x000D_
- Conservation of the environment. Mushroom is nature's recycling system and eco _x000D_
friendly. From planting to packaging to deliveries, Kwa Mushroom Farm will use _x000D_
materials that can easily decompose and not pollute the environment. Mushroom _x000D_
thrive off decaying vegetation and other agricultural waste. This encourages re-cycling of waste materials._x000D_
- Schools that do not have a healthy diet to it's pupils will have the opportunity to _x000D_

Our goal at the Foundation is to train the community on the best practices of sustainable organic farming and agro forestry. _x000D_
In Siaya county and in Kenya as a whole, we have witnessed reduced crop yields due to nutrient depletion and loss of soil biodiversity. Non regenerative farming practices have caused the problems over the long term but more recently the over-use of agro chemicals as fertilizer and pest controls have made the problems worse._x000D_
_x000D_
And then there's  climate change._x000D_
_x000D_
 It's  not just the burning of fossil fuels that is causing global climate disruption,_x000D_
Large scale factory farming is also contributing   significantly to the problem._x000D_
 In my short lifetime I have witnessed additional crop failures due to the disruption  of our rainy seasons._x000D_
_x000D_
We believe that organic farming offers an alternative that can eliminate many of the environmental problems  caused by the contemporary, unsustainable agricultural practices. Instead of using petroleum derived chemicals to fertilize and protect crops, farmers learn to see more natural alternatives.  _x000D_
They learn how to use natural composts, mulches and bio insecticides/pesticides that recycle nutrients and control pests and weeds. _x000D_
They  lean about companion planting and permaculture. We are using crops and plants such as pyrethrum, garlic, red pepper to produce insecticides and pesticides that are environmentally friendly. _x000D_
_x000D_
At The Polly Foundation, our goal is to shift  towards the health and wellbeing of the community. To  restore the culture in agriculture.","Our first customers for bio farm products will be the small scale farmers in Siaya County who are willing to adopt organic farming and will be using our products in there farms._x000D_
Secondly, we will be selling our products to families/households who will be buying at affordable prices. ","Our Bio farm products such as insecticides and pesticides will be solving the issue of increased prices of farm inputs such as agro-chemicals which are pest control inputs as well as solving the issue of soil biodiversity._x000D_

There are many growing businesses and families that have mastered the use of technological way of doing things by the use of electrical appliances for various purposes. These products require regular servicing, repair and in some cases replacement thus the need to come up with this business._x000D_
With the available population and the continued growth in the area, the opportunity to serve Kisumu county residents will gradually increase.

Lastly, most people who sell electrical appliances normally do not offer installation and other after sale services, our aim is to ensure that we sell to our customers and help them with fitting of various appliances and teach them how to operate them.","With the rise in technology in kenya and the upward drift of usage of electronics and electrical appliances at homes, hotels and institutions, there is need to  come up with a business that will ensure constant supply of efficient skilled  technicians to offer repairs and installation services of both refrigeration and air conditioning systems and electrical appliances._x000D_

The fresh produce comes from farms around the county already with vegetables. The main concept is to ensure homesteads get vegetables at any time of the day without necessarily accessing the market. This will save homesteads the cost of transport to markets and will provide them a range of fresh organic products by a click of a button. I am into this because there is a high demand for fresh products in Kisumu which mainly come from counties outside the Nyanza region. The quick acquisition of farm products will see motivation of farmers within Kisumu hence increased farming activities due to market availability. I believe there is a gap in farming in Kisumu and its environs hence the need to introduce efficient farm products delivery that will lead to increased farm output in the long run by contracting farmers. My business hence solves the agricultural equation by delivering products to households and institutions,"My vegetable delivery business is serving households in the different existing and emerging  estates of Kisumu county. My business also seeks to serve hotels, restaurants and institutions like schools and hospitals within the county.  These institutes are huge consumers of vegetables which go through hurdles to access fresh farm products ",Households in Kisumu buy farm products in markets places which are  perceived to be so congested a no go zone especially in these times of the pandemic. Farmers take their products to the market through middlemen who sell the products at a doubled price hence customers buy at exorbitant prices. My business does away with the middlemen since it takes these products directly to houses. This enables people to buy products at cheap prices. My businesses also saves people the hectic work of going to market places thus saving on time and transport costs because delivery is done at the doorstep. Institutions will have fresh products delivered to them without going through the hustle and bustle of markets ,1-2 years,"Less than ksh 50,000","My business lacks a good premises for storage, sorting and packaging my products.

Come to think of it, if this business has been taking place for years and years, why would people do it only because they have no other option? Pineapples sellers have regarded and believed that they are a poor category of the Kochia society, and for this reason originates the onset of THIRO CHAN LIMITED which has a direct translation of ""stagnating poverty"" within Kochia pineapple sellers at Olare Centre._x000D_
The company will receive pineapples directly from farmers, Unlike the current situation where the sellers themselves reach out to the farmers, an issue that has resulted shortage of pineapples due to reduced sale of pineapples as a result of increased prices which sellers shift to the customers to match the cost of availing the pineapples._x000D_

There is no juice production at Olare Centre even with its good name of producing a very sweet fruit.

There is going to be a  welfare group within my business, that is going to be one that is constituted by the pineapple sellers, one where they can address challenges that they are facing along side the recommendations that they have concerning pineapple production._x000D_
THIRO CHAN has a long term focus of doing large scale production of pineapples in the near future, after which setting up a pineapple factory in Kochia, something that has been a dream to most of the women selling this fruit. It is the aim of this business set up a place where pineapple sellers might rely on when economic conditions hit the rock.","THIRO CHAN KOCHIA PINEAPPLE LIMITED will serve local Centre pineapple sellers at Olare.

The pineapple seller at Olare Centre is one that has loosed hope in success and in becoming wealthy people. Most sell pineapples in order to get daily meals, and whatever they earn is never enough to support their bills._x000D_

We at Sage Graphics and Packaging take it upon ourselves to come up with packaging concepts and branding, then use our creativity to produce packaging material at an affordable price. For example a youth who has just started a fruit export business might find it hard to come up with the branding on the packaging boxes as well as finding a high quality packaging material for the fruits. Our work is creating designs for the brand as well as sourcing for materials such as corrugated cartons which we then brand, cut and create a beautiful, strong and durable carton packaging for that small fruit selling/export business._x000D_
Therefore, our business, focuses on branding and creation of packaging materials.  ","My business will focus on young entrepreneurs who are trying to introduce their product to the market, and need high quality branded packaging which will give them an edge against established brands in the market. _x000D_
My target customers lie especially in young people selling manufactured products like hand sanitizers, masks, detergents and soaps which need to be well branded and packaged with high quality material to give them a competing chance with already established brands in the market. ","When starting this journey to self-employment during the start of this year (2021), I noticed a lot of young people who lost their jobs due to the Corona pandemic were all starting businesses. One of the key challenge these businesses faced was the lack of proper branding and packaging of their products in a manner that would attract and satisfy the customer's confidence in the product. In most of the cases many youths ventured into the sale of hand sanitizers. These hand sanitizers were of high quality, the problem was poor and shabby looking packaging which cannot attract an average customer. For example established brands such as Velvex, had better looking packaging than what most youths offered their customers. Because of poor looking packaging, many businesses formed by these youths could not get sufficient market share for their products to survive. At times supermarkets and other retailers rejected their products as substandard just because of the poor looking packaging._x000D_
Besides, youths starting fruit export business find it a challenge to procure high quality corrugated cartons which can carry Avocados or Bananas (which are bulky) to meet the export standard. Companies in Kenya who sell this cartons are big packaging firms who focus on big players that buy in large quantities, therefore, somebody with small quantities is not able to find this product. Sage Graphics and Packaging will buy in large quantities this cartons, then cut and brand to its many small customers.",0-6 months,"Less than ksh 50,000",The biggest challenge Sage Graphics and Packaging faces is the acquisition of printers and die-cutting machines that print and shape these packaging materials to the clients specification.,No,,Sage Graphics and Packaging would like to receive financial help to purchase printing and Die-cutting machines that are integral to a packaging solutions business. ,Facebook post,,"The National Youth Council should continue finding better ways of communicating to the youth so that their programs are known to the youth.

This field encompasses a vicious chain to be followed to aid in the maintenance of food sufficiency, meeting consumer demands and growth of the Nations GDP. Within this chain, the vital element is the producer who in this case is the local farmer. _x000D_
The Agricultural sector is faces with a number of highly complex problems which affect the chain system greatly. The Farmer is caught at a cross road since he/she has to suffer the consequences at a greater level than others within the chain. Agriculture is also wide and a lucrative business area individuals can invest in and make an income out of it.  _x000D_
To start, develop ,invest and grow the venture is an upheaval task since the field is also encompassed with disinformation. Entreprenuers therefore end up starting ventures that only make them incur loses at the end of the day. _x000D_
To try solve these challenges and strengthen this sector, the entreprenual idea I came up with is through the creation and invention of an Agricultural App that; _x000D_
1. Contains details concerning planting of Agricultural products._x000D_
2. Contains information concerning better farming practices._x000D_
3. Contains details on various Crop diseases and measures of combating these disease's._x000D_
4. Contains information concerning various types of seeds to plant with and those that ensure proper harvest._x000D_
5. Contains details on the amount of capital to be used to buy the seeds, start the venture and investments to be made as the business venture grows sporadically._x000D_
This app is also an all user app that can be used by every individual no matter the place or technological means one has at his disposal. The app is also linked to safaricom servers thus makes an individual access all this information easily through dialing particular numbers. This would be a great investment area since farmers would have concrete, factual, scientifically proven information at their disposal.","_x000D_
The app targets individuals who want to venture into Agriculture as entreprenuers and the individual subsistence farmers._x000D_
For the individual subsistence farmers, the app will be able to increase their knowledge in agriculture to boost their production levels and be food sufficient. For entreprenuers the app is important to help them start enterprises agriculture related and make profits.","The business app seeks to address the ain of the rise of misinformation pertaining the agricultural sector and the limited access to information from the already existing apps.

2. Limited information within the already existing apps._x000D_

It will cost someone 550 per person per hour and during the weekends couples will be given a special offer of 900 per couples._x000D_
Next to the bowling arena pool tables,foosball and air-hockey should be nearby so that the people waiting not to be bored as there might be long queues before accessing the same. Bar and restaurant should be nearby in order for customers to be able to get software drinks readily and at favourable prices._x000D_
Payment can be through cash, via MPESA or via card. You’ll leave your shoes at the counter and handed a pair of bowling shoes. You should always remember to wear or carry a pair of socks. If you don’t you can purchase the same around the mall depending on the cost it is offered at. The wait time depends on the traffic and can be anything from 30 minutes to 1 hour._x000D_
There is a  bowling ball, there’s the bowling lane, there are 10 bowling pins and there’s a screen to keep score. Each bowler has 10 rounds (frames) which contain two rolls each._x000D_
In pin bowling, the goal is to knock over pins at the end of a lane, with two balls per frame allowed to knock down all pins. A strike is achieved when all the pins are knocked down on the first roll, and a spare is achieved if all the pins are knocked over on a second roll._x000D_
one point is scored for each pin that is knocked over. So if a player bowls over three pins with the first shot, then six with the second, the player would receive a total of nine points for that frame. If a player knocks down 9 pins with the first shot, but misses with the second, the player would also score nine. When a player fails to knock down all ten pins after their second ball it is known as an open frame. In the event that all ten pins are knocked over by a player in a single frame, bonuses are awarded._x000D_
At the counter, names are submitted  so that they may be entered in the system to maintain turns and keep score. The order of names/turns is not alphabetical but it is  as you list them during registration._x000D_
_x000D_
There’s no real ‘How To’ manual to read before you bowl. Just knock over as many pins at the end of the lane to beat your opponents.  The gutter must be avoided if a ball is to knock down any pins. If your ball enters a gutter, it goes on straight without knocking any pins and you get a zero. The bumper is a guard that prevents your ball from falling straight into the gutter._x000D_

",1-2 years,"ksh 50,000-100,000","Our main challenge is most  Kenyans put less value to this kind of technical training than university or college tertiary education. Parents and the community as a whole look down on such value based skills so many bright students often veer away from this trainings. Technically, we have  became the dumping ground for those whose academic capacity is not up to the requirements of higher learning. _x000D_
_x000D_
Lack of industry experience for many TVET teachers._x000D_
TVET institutions cannot really hire trainers from industry as their fees are much higher. Often, TVET institutions have to hire graduates of the Government teacher training institution._x000D_
_x000D_
In one country, the graduate of this type of training institution are sent to technical colleges each year regardless of the schools needs. These new teachers have few technical skills._x000D_
_x000D_
Hasty generalisation out of experience makes youth think one has to pass  not land them high-paying jobs. Whereas, TVET institutions offering courses relevant to the needs of the market are getting students working to support themselves in these courses. _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Equipment from previous investments are left idle due to the expensive trading supplies, no capacity to repair the imported equipment, and few knowing how to use it. Some of this equipment has already become relics of previous industrial requirements. _x000D_
_x000D_
We also face very little contribution from the private sector . The private sector would rather spend money to train their own workforce than look into such valuer based training. The end result is those private sectors end up receiving  the poor quality of the course offerings. _x000D_
_x000D_
There is also a challenge of finances. This training require some capital, and without it, managing the course becomes difficult. _x000D_
",No,,"We would appreciate a chance to be linked with industry technocrats from your end in order to be guided to the best direction regarding how to best make the trainings key and financially viable.

_x000D_
In any youth engagement effort, young people should be involved in design and decision-making from the beginning. Even the most in-tune adult allies cannot understand youth needs as well as young people themselves. Partner with young people in all steps, from assessing your organisations readiness to designing an implementation plan. _x000D_
_x000D_
2. Develop a clear purpose and implementation plan_x000D_
_x000D_
Establishing goals and objectives up front will inform the format of your youth engagement activities, provide direction for program designers, define desired outcomes, and help you get buy-in from decision-makers. What are the expected results? _x000D_

3 Provide young people with meaningful roles_x000D_
_x000D_
Youth roles will vary depending on the implementation plan, but it is essential that young people are valued, empowered, and afforded an opportunity to contribute in meaningful ways._x000D_

4. Provide the right support and training_x000D_
_x000D_
While empowerment is a critical component of any youth engagement effort, this does not translate to a sink-or-swim approach. It is important to provide young people with the support they need to succeed, which may include training, mentorship, facilitation, coordination, and protection. _x000D_

It's the type on demand in the market, with a market penetration of 95.2%.","The greatest demand of mushrooms in the country is here in Nairobi. _x000D_
The Ministry of Health estimates that more that 100,000 deaths annually, are lifestyle related. Mushrooms contain antioxidants that help protect the body from damaging free radicals that can cause conditions like heart disease and cancer. _x000D_

From this information, the target population segment are the adults, above 35 years, who according to 2019 census are 12 million; 25% of the entire population. _x000D_

This is an enormous market niche. Kenya services this deficit by importing from Rwanda. This isn't an effective solution as the mode of transportation is by road. Mushrooms are highly perishable with little self life, hence once they arrive in the country the consumer product not only doesn't it taste good, but most of them have gone bad._x000D_
_x000D_
Nutritious Mushrooms been a local producer will firstly curb the high importation rate of Mushrooms. This will enhance the Nation's balance of trade and become one of the metrics of strengthening the Kenyan Currency and, the customers will have more mushrooms at lowered prices by KSH 100/=._x000D_

The local production capacity of filling the local market gap has the potential of creating 1,400 jobs. _x000D_

Rwanda also exports to the rest of East Africa. Kenya naturally has a competitive  edge over Rwanda in exporting in the East African region, boosted by the good regional integration of Kenya and her neighbors.

As Ecosokoni, we believe market is there for any farm produce provided it is food for consumption. That is why we provide a solution through our platforms such as the mobile application available in Google playstore and social media platforms. _x000D_
_x000D_
When going out to get market for farmers, we got to realise in most cases the producer hardly knows what the consumer wants. Take for example strawberries one of our major flagship products, it is common among consumers to complain of bitter strawberries in the market yet it is a fruit meant to be sweet._x000D_
_x000D_
Through this we realised we also need to be involved in production to show farmers on how to produce quality yields.","Our business seeks to serve both small scale farmers in accessing market and agronomic support and consumers seeking for food sources they can trust._x000D_

","Urban poor low income population and business men. We targets low-income markets where affordability is everything. Meaning customers with limited incomes are offered an opportunity to purchase smaller sized portions for the lowest possible bulk prices. Our convenient distribution system can greatly outcompete sachets and other small format packaging on the per unit cost of products. In addition to offering economically inclusive consumption, we also enable low-resource customers to decouple product consumption from packaging waste._x000D_

We aim at creating a new retail ecosystem of product refilling","Mismanaged single-use plastic bottles are creating a worldwide crisis. Single-use bottles account for 14% of plastic waste (Plastic Oceans 2019). Single-use bottles are especially problematic in low-income community as the region often lacks effective waste management systems and many regions have heavy seasonal rains that disperse plastic waste._x000D_
The root problem with single-use bottle pollution (and other plastic packaging) is that single-use plastic is inexpensive and convenient. A promising solution that can eliminate the need for ~1/5 of the world’s single-use plastic are innovative reusable packaging distribution systems. We aim at reducing the need for single-use packaging by offering inclusive distributed network of franchised solar powered smart reusable re-fillers dispensers that changes consumption that maximizes convenience while minimizing product cost on an issue of ‘Poverty tax’ where people pay for packaging instead of the product packaging _x000D_
Reusable distribution systems can offer excellent convenience and cost-savings-the most critical variables to motivate consumers to embrace reusable packaging opportunities.
