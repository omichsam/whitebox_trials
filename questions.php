                                                Whitebox allows for both
 physical and online submission of innovations. An innovator can walk 
into any Whitebox office and make physical submissions. The Portal makes
 it possible for innovators to build their online portfolios over time, 
and when ready, submit their profiles for consideration.

transformation of local innovations and ventures into viable sustainable
 business enterprises has continually been stifled by lack of capital, 
limited expert guidance and poor access to markets. By aggregating 
stakeholders and relevant partners, the Whitebox will be a national 
connector for local ventures to access funds, capacity building and 
access to market opportunities. <br>Whitebox is intended to facilitate 
the introduction of local ventures to government ministries, 
departments, agencies, counties and the private sector to promote local <br> co-innovation and adoption of local content in the spirit of <em>‘Buy Kenya, Build Kenya’</em>.

                                            Our rigorous process 
identifies issues and actively manages any potential conflicts arising. 
We operate on the strict principle of confidentiality and precedence. We
 consider first person to <b> articulate, describe and <u>reduce to practice</u> </b>
 an idea as the Intellectual Property Owner. We define simultaneity of 
delivery of a concept as being within 6 hours of each other - in which 
case we consider simultaneously delivered ideas to be co-owned. This is 
still a matter under consideration and your views will be carefully 
considered. The Whitebox, it’s officials and associates undertakes NOT 
to independently develop, implement or execute on any idea submitted to 
it - we operate under the principles of utmost good faith and probity.
